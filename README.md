# About
## My name is Mckayla Sanchez and I am currently a senior at the University of Denver graduating in Spring 2022 with a double major in Business Information & Analytics and Marketing. I am originally from San Diego, California but chose to attend the University of Denver to swim at a division I school while attending a prestigious business school. I have interned for the Denver based company Swimming Simply as their intern in the Social Media and Google Analytics team where I strengthened their marketing and presence on social media as well as implemented Google Analytics to track their market. My hobbies include swimming, hiking, going to the beach, or basically anything outdoors in the sun. I am proficient in SQL, R, Python, Tableau, JMP, Visio, Visual Studio, VBA, and Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I am also certified in Microsoft Access, Excel, Powerpoint, and Word. I strive to work for a company that puts people first and continues to foster the growth and opportunities for their employees.
